	<title>Trillium - Shards</title>
		<p>I tried moving with grace
At the pinnacle of our failure
But you were only saving face

And after all of our mistakes
And all the changes I’m still the same
I thank God for all my strenght
And now I’m much better off today
Though it cost me so much pain
Now you show up and you say
</p>
	<p>Could you not forgive
And can you not forget
Bitterness is no remedy in sorting
Through this pile of glass

You ask me to forgive
And say you’ll be my friend
Your ignorance is the malady
In sorting through these
		Shards of broken glass</p>
	<p>It’s all painfully cliché
How you wanted to play the savior
Without owning any blame

You might’ve dodget the ricochet
But there are dues that you left unpaid
And it’ll all come back one day
</p>
